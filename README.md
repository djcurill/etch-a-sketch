# Etch-a-Sketch
---
Web application of the popular game *Etch-a-Sketch*. Using event handlers, mouse movements over grids will colour in `div` elements. Users can change the resolution of the grid by scaling up or down the cell size with a toggle bar. All cells can be reset by selecting a *wipe* button. 

This app was built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The core focus of this exercise was to hone in on Event Handling, DOM manipulation & CSS Grid.

Enjoy!
